# BusesAreUs

- An Android application that maps the location of stops and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system (Translink) and retrieves real time arrival information at those stops. It also plots the user's location on the map and highlights the nearest bus stop. To do this, the app makes use of TransLink Open API - a service that is provided free of charge.

- I am not permitted to upload my code onto GitHub due to school policies. For anyone who is concerned about this project, they may inquire about it by directly sending me a private message.
